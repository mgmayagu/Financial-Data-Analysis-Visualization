# Financial Data Analysis Visualization
For our final project in our data visualizations course, we decided to analyze our financial data for the years of 2019 and 2020. We were curious about our spending habits throughout the year as college students and wanted to compare the time periods, categories, and seasons we spent the most money in. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we were able to create a series of visualizations to present our desired results. 

All of our visualizations, as well as the analysis of our spending can be found on our website which you can run locally once cloning this repository. See "Getting Started" for more details.
